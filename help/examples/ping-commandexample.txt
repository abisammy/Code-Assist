Use whatever command handler you want, I will just give an example of the code you need to put in your execute, (it could be called run, or callback or something similar).

```js
    const { MessageEmbed } = require("discord.js")
    const { channel } = message

    const pingEmbed = new MessageEmbed()
    .setAuthor("Ping pong! üèì")
    .setColor("#7289DA")
    // If you use a command handler like Discord.js-Commando, you need to change client.ws.ping to this.client.ws.ping
    .setDescription(`The API latency is \`\`${client.ws.ping} ms!\`\``)

    channel.send(pingEmbed)
```

If you have any common errors, try to trouble shoot them with the bot before asking someone for help
