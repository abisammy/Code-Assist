Use whatever command handler you want, I will just give an example of the code you need to put in your execute, (it could be called run, or callback or something similar).
You can replace args with what you noremally use, it could be something like arguments
If using discord.js-commando, make sure you add ``argsType: "multiple",`` on the top, where you call the things such as the name or description

   **Make sure you run "npm i coinflip" to use this command**

```js
 const { channel } = message

//we call the conflip() function inside of the if statement
if (coinflip()) {
    //then we send a message that's either Heads or Tails.
     channel.send(`:coin: Heads!`);
    } else {
     channel.send(`:coin: Tails!`);
    }
        
}
}
```
