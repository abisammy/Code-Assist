Sending code will be much easier following this tutorial

Lets say you needed some help with your code, and you decided to ask in a server. This is some code for a simple embed: 
```js
const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
.setTitle("This is an embed"), 
.setDescription("Isnt it cool?");
message.channel.send(embed)```


**If you send code in a server, please dont send it like this**
const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
.setTitle("This is an embed"), 
.setDescription("Isnt it cool?")
nmessage.channel.send(embed)


There are multiple ways to improve sending it
Here are two examples


**Option one** add three backticks(`` ` ``) and a js, before and after your code
This is how it will look like
\`\`\`js
YOUR CODE
\`\`\`

The result will look a little like
```js
const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
.setTitle("This is an embed"), 
.setDescription("Isnt it cool?");
message.channel.send(embed)```

**Option two** use [sourcebin](https://sourceb.in/) to send your code!
Sourcebin is made for users to easily send code, and might just help you! Check it out [here](https://sourceb.in/)


**Why is this useful?**
Some servers might enforce a rule that you need to use backtics before sending code, while in all cases it makes it easier for the person trying to help you to understand your code.
