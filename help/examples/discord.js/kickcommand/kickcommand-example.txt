Use whatever command handler you want, I will just give an example of the code you need to put in your execute, (it could be called run, or callback or something similar).

```js
  // Destructure the channel, mentions author and guild
    const { channel, mentions, author, guild } = message;
    
    // This is the person to kick
    const member = mentions.members.first();
    
    // If they didnt mention a member then tell the user
    if (!member)
        return channel.send("Please mention the person you want to kick");
    
    // If they try to kick themselves return
    if (member.id === author.id)
        return channel.send("You can't kick yourself");

    // If the user running the command doesnt have permission to kic kmembers return
    if (!message.member.permissions.has("KICK_MEMBERS")) {
        return channel.send(
            "You dont have the ``kick members`` permission to run this command!"
        );
    }

    // If the person you are trying to kick can't be kicked by the bot, return
    if (!member.kickable) {
        return channel.send("I cannot kick that user!");
    }

    // Tell the user they have been kicked
    await member
        .send(`You have been kicked from ${guild.name}`)
        .catch(() => {
            return;
        });

    // Kick the user
    member.kick();
    channel.send(`<@${member.id}> has been kicked!`);
```

**Things you can add**
- Make sure the user has a moderaotr role, instead of the kick members permission
- Make sure the person you are trying to kick is not a staff member
- Change the regular messages to embeds
- A logs channel

If you have any common errors, try to trouble shoot them with the bot before asking someone for help
