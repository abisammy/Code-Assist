Use whatever command handler you want, I will just give an example of the code you need to put in your execute, (it could be called run, or callback or something similar).
You can replace args with what you noremally use, it could be something like arguments
If using discord.js-commando, make sure you add ``argsType: "multiple",`` on the top, where you call the things such as the name or description

```js
const { MessageEmbed } = require("discord.js")
const { channel } = message

//for generating embeds we are working with argument checks.

//first we create 2 variables for the arguments.
let title = args[0]
let color = args[1]

//with the splice() method we return the removed items in an array. 
//then right after that we join all the elements of the array into a string. 
let description = args.splice(2).join(' ')
//the same goes for the msg variable we are joining the arguments of the array into a string.
let msg = args.join(' '); 


//here we are making two checks, if either the title or color arent specified it will return with an arror message.
if(!title) return message.channel.send("invalid arguments please use: title(one word), color(hex code or basic colors in caps; i.e(RED), Description") 
if(!color) return message.channel.send("invalid color")

/here we are creating the embed. 
const embed = new MessageEmbed()
//we fill the title and color with the variables we created earlier
.setTitle(title)
.setColor(color)

//the description is where you fill in the text of the embed
.setDescription(description)

//then we set a timestamp of when the embed was created(optional)
.setTimestamp()     

//and lastly we generate a footer that shows who created the embed and their avatar
.setFooter(`Embed Generated By: ${message.author.tag}`, message.author.displayAvatarURL({dynamic: true}))
//then we send the embed into the channel.
channel.send(embed)
    
```
