Use whatever command handler you want, I will just give an example of the code you need to put in your execute, (it could be called run, or callback or something similar).
You can replace args with what you noremally use, it could be something like arguments
If using discord.js-commando, make sure you add ``argsType: "multiple",`` on the top, where you call the things such as the name or description

     **Make sure you run "npm i ms" to use this command**

```js

const ms = require('ms')
const { channel } = message

//we start by making 3 variables. one for the arguments, the message author and one for the reminder
let time = args[0];
let user = message.author
//with the splice() method we return the removed items in an array. 
//then right after that we join all the elements of the array into a string. 
let reminder = args.splice(1).join(' ')

//here we first check if an argument is provided. if not we will return an error message.
if (!args[0]) return channel.send("Please specify the time!")
//then we check if the argument provided is not one of the listed time formats we will also return an error message.
if (
    !args[0].endsWith("d") &&   
    !args[0].endsWith("m") &&
    !args[0].endsWith("h") &&
    !args[0].endsWith("s")
    )
    return channel.send("Sorry I only do d, m, h, or s.")

//if the user doesn't provide a reminer we will return an error message
if (!reminder) return message.channel.send("Please tell me what you want to be reminded off")

//if the user runs the command correctly we return a success message
channel.send(`Your reminder will go off in ${time}`)
    { SPLIT }
//lastly we make a function that will send the reminder to the user.
setTimeout(async function () {
    //we put te command in a try catch function to make sure we don't get an error when the user has the bot blocked or dm turned off
    try{
    //then we send the user the dm. Make sure you use the await operator to run this command,


    //this makes sure the message is only sent when every other step has been succesfully executed 
    await user.send(`It has been ${time} here is your reminder: ${reminder}`)
    }catch(err){
        
    }          
}, ms(time));
```


If you have any common errors, try to trouble shoot them with the bot before asking someone for help
