Use whatever command handler you want, I will just give an example of the code you need to put in your execute, (it could be called run, or callback or something similar).
You can replace args with what you noremally use, it could be something like arguments
If using discord.js-commando, make sure you add ``argsType: "multiple",`` on the top, where you call the things such as the name or description

```js
// Destrucutre author and channel
const { author, channel } = message

// Define the tag and message
let tag = author.tag
let message = args.join(" ")

// Make sure the message is under 2000 characters (discords limmit)
if (message.length >= 2000){
    return channel.send("That message is too long!")
}

// Send the message
channel.send(`${tag}: ${message}`)
```

**Things to add**
- Detect when a player uses @everyone or @here
- A bad words filter

If you have any common errors, try to trouble shoot them with the bot before asking someone for help
