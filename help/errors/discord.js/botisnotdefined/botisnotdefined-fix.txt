There are a few possibilities to fix this.

One possible explanation could be you have named it client instead of bot. A way to check what you called it would be to check these lines of code:
```js
const Discord = require("discord.js)
/* If this is client, then that means you need to replace where you put bot with client*/

const client = new Discord.Client()
```

Another possible explanation is that you have not passed in your client
Here is an example
```js
// In the main file
const changeStatus = require("./change-status.js")

changeStatus(client, newStatus)
//           ^^^^^^
//           You pass in client here

// In change-status.js
module.exports = (newStatus) => {
//                ^^^^^^^^^  
//                But don't recieve it here
        client.user.setPresence({
        status: "online",
        activity: {
            name: newStatus,
            type: "WATCHING",
        },
    });
}
```

That code was for code to change the status of the bot, but you could have missed the client in any other file that requires it
