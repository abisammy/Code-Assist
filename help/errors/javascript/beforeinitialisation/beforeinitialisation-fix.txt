Lets say you want to have an embed, here is an example
```js
console.log(int)
let int = 5
```

What is the problem with that code you may ask, well I will show you
```js
console.log(int)
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Here you conole.log int

let int = 5
// ^^^^^^^^
// But you define int after you log it
```

If you are stil having problems at this point ask someone to help you
