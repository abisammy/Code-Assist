This one is simple, you provided a comma to extra, a bracket to less

One extention I recomend you install to help reduce this error if you are using [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)(check it out its free)
Is [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)

This allows you to visualise opening and closing brackets, to make sure you don't have one too many or one too little

If you are stil having problems at this point ask someone to help you
