You may have gotten this error and are wondering whats causing it:

```js
 await is only valid in async function
 ```

This is because you are using await, without putting async before the function, I will explain what I mean.

In any file, you might want to do something like
```js
await console.log("HI")
```

That will throw and error if it is not in an asynchronous function, one possible fix could be: 
```js
async function consoleLog(){
    await console.log("HI")
}
consoleLog()
```

Another possible problem could be in a command folder, you would have all the things like:
```js
name: "test",
desription: "test",
execute(message){
    await console.log("HI")
}
```

To fix this you could do:
```js
name: "test",
desription: "test",
async execute(message){
    await console.log("HI")
}
```
