You probably have had a typo or forgot to define something, or you could have not passed in parameters correctly.
Here is an example
```js
let number = 6
console.log(nuber)
```
In that example number is mispelled in the console.log so it is going to throw an error

another example could be:
```js
function consoleLog(text){
    console.log(tet)
}
consoleLog("hi")
```
You pass in the parameter, but you do console.log(tet) instead of console.log(text)

A whole other reason could be you just havent added it in, or maybe just commented it out by accident
```js
// let int = 6

console.log(int)
```

```js
function consoleLogWithEmoji(text){
    console.log(text, emoji)
}
let text = "Hello"
let emoji = "ðŸ˜Š"

consoleLogWithEmoji(text, emoji)
```
Here there would be an error, as you are passing in the text and the emoji, but you are not receivieng it in the function

If you are still having problems at this point ask someone to help you
