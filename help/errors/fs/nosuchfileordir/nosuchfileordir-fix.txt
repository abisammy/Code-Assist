This error basically means, that the code cannot find the file path you have provided with fs.

 One possible explanation for this could be that fs looks for files from the root of the directory, rather than relative paths like in regular javascript, here is an example:
 ```js
 const fs = require("fs)
 let errorFiles = fs.readdirSync("./../help/errors", { withFileTypes: true })
                .filter((dirent) => dirent.isDirectory())
                .map((dirent) => dirent.name);
conole.log(errorFiles)
 ```
 The problem is that fs is looking for the help folder from the root, so it would be help/errors instead of ./../help/errors

 You may be wodering about this code and why I chose help and errors, the reason is this is how the bot is formated, and this bot is actually open source!
