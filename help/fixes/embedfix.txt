Lets say you are trying to send an embed
One possibility is that you have names the embed differently here is an example

```js
const { MessageEmbed } = require("discord.js")
const { channel } = message

const newEmbed = new MessageEmbed()
//    ^^^^^^^^
//    Here you call it newEmbed
.setAuthor("this is an embed")
.setDescription("Isnt it cool")
.setColor("#FF0000")
.addField("But it isnt gonna work", "ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢");

channel.send(embed)
//           ^^^^^
//           But here you call embed
```

That code was for code to change the status of the bot, but you could have missed the client in any other file that requires it

If you are stil having problems at this point ask someone to help you
