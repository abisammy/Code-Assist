This error can be caused just by a little typo, here is how you could asses it

Lets say you wanted to send a message to a specific channel, you would do
```js
const channel = client.channel.cache.get("CHANNEL_ID")
//                       ^^^^^^^
//                       client.channels not client.channel
channel.send("hi")
```
The reas its client.channels not client.channel can be read in these [docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client?scrollTo=channels)

Another solution to this problem, could be something o do with your command and command handler, here I will use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUOb9_aAk7U) to explain

In the video, code lyon does in his main.js: 
```js
if (command === "ping"){
    client.commands.get("ping").execute(message, args, client, Discord)
}
```
And in his ping.js

```js
name: "ping",
desription: "Pong!",
async execute(message, args, Discord, client){
    client.channels.cache.get("CHANNEL_ID").send("Pong!")
}
```
Can you see the problem? lt me highlight it for you

```js
// main.js
if (command === "ping"){
    client.commands.get("ping").execute(message, args, client, Discord)
}                                   
//                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                      You pass in message, args, client, Discord here

// ping.js
name: "ping",
desription: "Pong!",
async execute(message, args, Discord, client){
//            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
//            But here you reacive message, args, Discord, client  
    client.channels.cache.get("CHANNEL_ID").send("Pong!")
}
```

What all this means, is that you are trying to find the channels property from Discord, not client so it gives an error
