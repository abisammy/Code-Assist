Console.log is a very helpful tool in javascript, what you didn't know however is that you can console.log with a color! Here is an example

```js
console.log(`\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m`, "This is red!")
```

Here is a full list of colors:
```
    Black: 30
    Red: 31
    Green: 32
    Yellow: 33
    Blue: 34
    Magenta: 35
    Cyan: 36
    White: 37
```

All you need to do to console.log in a specific color you want is replace this number
```js
    console.log(`\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m`, "This is red!")
    //                ^^
    //                Replace that number with one of the numbers from above to console.log in a specific color!

```

**Things to do after this tutorial:**
- Make this as a function, so you can access it anywhere in your bot
- Store the colors in a JSON file

If you have any common errors, try to trouble shoot them with the bot before asking someone for help
