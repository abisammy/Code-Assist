Use whatever command handler you want, I will just give an example of the code you need to put in your execute, (it could be called run, or callback or something similar).
```js
const { MessageEmbed } = require("discord.js")
        //either the person you mention or the person who 
        //runs the command. 
         const user = message.mentions.users.first() || 
         message.author;

    //this sends the message in to the channel.  
    const { channel } = message
    // here we create the embed to put the users avatar in.
     const avatarEmbed = new MessageEmbed()
        // we set a color for the embed(could be either 
        // RANDOM, a specific color in caps: (RED) or a 
        // hex color code like: #F30B04). 
    .setColor("RANDOM")
     // then we put the users discord tag in the footer. 
    .setFooter(`${user.tag}'s avatar!`)
     // the last step is to send the actual avatar of the user 
    .setImage(user.displayAvatarURL({size: 4096, dynamic: true}))
     // if the image is too small you can always change the 
     //size to your linking.
    
    channel.send(avatarEmbed)
         
```

**Things you can add**
- you could add a link to the users avatar in the top of the embed so people can download it easily.
