This error's fix is simpler than you think.

Either you named your discord element different, or you didnt require it in the first place. Here are two examples

```js
const Discord = require("discord.js")
//    ^^^^^^^
// Here you call it Discord with a capital D

const embed = new discord.MessageEmbed()
//                ^^^^^^^
//                Here you call it discord with a small d

.setAuthor("this is an embed")
.setDescription("Isnt it cool")
.setColor("#FF0000")
.addField("But it isnt gonna work", "ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢");

```

A second explanation could be:
```js
const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
//                ^^^^^^^  
//                Here you call Discord, but you dont define it earlier

.setAuthor("this is an embed")
.setDescription("Isnt it cool")
.setColor("#FF0000")
.addField("But it isnt gonna work", "ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢");
```
