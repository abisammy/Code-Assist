This error is a very common one and you shouldn't worry if you get it

To help explain the problem, I will be using a command handler made by Code Lyon, watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUOb9_aAk7U)

In the video, Code Lyon creates a simple ping pong command, like this: 
```js
    // ping.js
    module.exports = {
    name: "ping",
    description: "this is a ping command!",
    execute(message, args) {
        message.channel.send("pong!");
    },
};
```

And in the main file he adds 
```js    
// main.js
if (command === "ping") {
    client.commands.get("ping").execute(message, args);
}
```

There could be multiple areas in which you could get this error, here are a few to name

**Firstly** you could not be mapping your commands right, this means that its not finding the correct command files, in the tutorial Code Lyon uses this to map his commands:
```js
const fs = require("fs");

client.commands = new Discord.Collection();

const commandFiles = fs
    .readdirSync("./commands/")
    .filter((file) => file.endsWith(".js"));
for (const file of commandFiles) {
    const command = require(`./commands/${file}`);

    client.commands.set(command.name, command);
}
```
**Make sure that its working correctly**, on the next line add:
```js
console.log(client.commands)
```

If that seems normal, the **second** possibility could be that your command file, is not set up properly. 
**1.** Make sure your js file ends with js and is called the exact same thing , for example my file is called ping.js, and the name inside is "ping", if it is not exact it will break the code
**2.** make sure there are no typos, it could be you spelled is as ``exeute`` or something simular

If you are stil having problems at this point ask someone to help you
