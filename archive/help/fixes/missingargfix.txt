This one is pretty simple

You probably have an axtra ``)`` or ``}``, or a missing ``)`` or ``}`` somewhere

An example of this could be:
```js
message.channel.send("hello"
```
You are missing a ) at the end and the code throws an error

If you are stil having problems at this point ask someone to help you
