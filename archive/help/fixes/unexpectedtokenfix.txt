This one is simple, you probably have misplased a comma, or bracket somewhere

One such example could be in a json file
```json
    "YOUR_KEY": "YOUR_VALUE",
```
That will throw an error becasue the comma tells it to expect a new datapoint.

If you are stil having problems at this point ask someone to help you
